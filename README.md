"Reinforcement learning is learning what to do—how to map situations to actions—so as to maximize a numerical reward signal." ([<sup>1</sup>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfPEJPHUllg&list=PLTl9hO2Oobd9kS--NgVz0EPNyEmygV1Ha&index=1))

This is the Agent-Environment interaction loop which is the core of many RL problems. The Agent does some action and interacts with the environment. The Environment returns a state and a reward, which will be used by the Agent to determine its next action.
